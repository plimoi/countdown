**Countdown Timer for the Display**

WPC Countdown Timer is a front-end solution for your online store, which means the tool is purely for the display purpose only. If you would like to create an event or take some proper sales-related actions such as “set out of stock”, “set sale price”, “set as unpurchasable”, etc., kindly refer to our other plugin [WPC Product Timer for WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-product-timer/ "WPC Product Timer for WooCommerce").

Unlike the WPC Product Timer, which works almost in the back-end for setting prices and sales events, WPC Countdown Timer only displays a timer to increase the urgency and has no actual influence on your products’ prices or stock status. When combining with WPC Product Timer, WPC Countdown Timer can bring about a wonderful yet simple method to effortlessly run sales events or campaigns. In future updates, we will bring even more beautiful adjustments in terms of appearance for you to put up on your site with WPC Countdown Timer.

**Active Status**

Users can choose to enable/ disable the active status for the timer separately on each product by choosing “Yes/No” in the Active option.

**Setting up the Timer**

When setting up the time, if you leave the starting time box empty, by default, the timer will start counting down from your current time (it starts right after your pressing the button to save the changes).

The ending time box must be filled with a specific date and time by choosing from the calendar popup, so that the timer will learn when the countdown ends and display the ending notification or hiding the timer accordingly based on your setting.

The ending notification text will be displayed in both shop archive and single product page when the timer ends in replacement of the whole timer block. If this box is left empty, by default, when the counting down ends, the timer will disappear completely from your store.

**Position Selection**

From the admin dashboard, navigate to WPClever >> Countdown Timer to adjust the position of the countdown timer block on the archive page and product page manually. You can put it under the products’ title, rating, price, under/ above the Add to cart button or Hide it.

= Translators =

Available languages: English (Default)
